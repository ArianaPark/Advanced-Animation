Ecosystem Phase Four\
\
In this phase, I refined the animals. The bugs (green circles) are in independent particle systems that constantly produce new bugs. The geese (gray circles) are attracted to and eat the bugs. Each time they eat a bug, the bug dies (turns red) and the goose gets bigger. The snakes move around and the head is attracted to the geese, but repels the geese as well (causes some chasing). When a snake eats a goose, the goose dies (turns red) and eventually decomposes (fades away). New geese are created every time a goose is eaten by a snake.}
